LAB 6: Essentials of the while loop

Scenario

Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.

Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.


The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:

  1
 2 3
4 5 6

Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers – if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.
